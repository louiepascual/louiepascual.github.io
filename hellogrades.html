<h1>Hello Grades!</h1>

<p>
Not something I should particulary be proud of, but then I was just curious how I performed while in College. 
My best semester was 1-1, because the academic work was still easy and I was not really participating in any school activities back then.
The big drop on 3-1 was when I became the President of our co-curricular organization plus the Chairperson of our sports team in our school. Although I passed everything that semester, it was difficult then to keep up with a lot work in both academics and activities. 
Note that in 3-3, it was my Summer OJT. So basically I only had one subject then so the QPI would naturally spike up.
